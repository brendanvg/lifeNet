need to work on naming different types of edges and searching/highlighint all edges of that type and also color coding different groups

loadEdges only graphing the first edge I added while clicking

visualize groups: by color.....with color key being updated


what to do when someone is in more than one group???

set max zoom out
 


resolve if value (in database) of a node is undefined, what to do (it will throw an error about not being able to read undefined when you try to add other things on...for example -> A node does not have a group name, but I want to add a position to it (by pushing it to the value array)....it will fail, with cannot read undefined.) ---solution?-> require all values
