-make the app so that anyone can customize and create their own networking app (graphical api---change color of central nodes, add forums to edges/nodes)


-my ideas
	-make it so that we can connect people as we branch out and make new relationships (laura in Central America, myself in Flint....)
	-each network be a body/ organism -- with organs to do specific functions
		-organs are big nodes with a task/function/ purpose essential to the body's well being -> i.e. legal research for Tru, fundraising, etc....
			- people can connect their nodes to multiple organs, and each organ has a public forum attached to it
	- make an app for a local (relatively fixed) community - i.e. golden corral coworkers
	-make an app for a local people trying to organize something new
		-i.e. Tru and the garden.....
